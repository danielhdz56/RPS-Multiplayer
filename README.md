# RPS-Multiplayer
### Overview
This is an online multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game, that uses Firebase to store player's information.
### Instructions
* The game setup:
  * Only two users can play at the same time.
  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.
  * There is also chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
